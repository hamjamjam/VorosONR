# Motion Perception During Visual Transitions

Psychophysical experiment developed in Unity to measure perception of position (and inferred angular velocity) during earth vertical yaw rotation.

Hardware:
Vive Pro Eye with Wireless add on (and all requisite sensors and base stations)
Vive Controllers (left and right)
VR Roto Chair (for earth vertical yaw motion)

Subjects used the button press task (press a button on the left/right controller every time you feel like you have rotated 90 degrees to the left/right) in order to report their sensation of motion.

6 different motion profiles are being used. 4 different lighting conditions are being used: lights on, lights on going off, lights off going on and lights off.
Each subject (that completed testing) did each motion profile in each of the different lighting conditions for a total of 6x4 = 24 motions (or "trials") per subject.

Data will be aggregated and used to inform development of the Observer model; a model of human motion perception.
